#### Introduction
This is the final project for the course "Data Science 2" at St. Olaf College. The goal of this project is to create a Shiny app that is able to generate graphs and tables based on the user's input. The app is designed to be user-friendly and interactive. The app is hosted on shinyapps.io and can be accessed [here](https://louiserosenbaum.github.io/shiny-final-project/).

For this project, we will be looking at statistics of the WNBA and D1 Women's basketball teams. The data was collected from the NCAA website and the WNBA website. The data includes the following variables: team name, conference, win-loss record, points per game, field goal percentage, 3-point percentage, free throw percentage, rebounds per game, assists per game, steals per game, blocks per game, and turnovers per game. 

#### Background Information
The WNBA regular season consists of 40 games, which concludes in September, compared to the NBA's 82-game regular season. The NBA season starts on Tuesday, October 24, while the WNBA season begins in May, coinciding with the NBA playoffs. The WNBA also uses a slightly smaller ball, measuring 28.5 inches in circumference, compared to the NBA's 29.5-inch ball. Additionally, the style of play differs significantly between the two leagues, with the WNBA often emphasizing teamwork, fundamentals, and strategic play, while the NBA is known for its fast pace, athleticism, and individual star power.
